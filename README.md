Aether Gravity is an immersive, interactive space simulation designed for creating and exploring custom universes. It combines rigorous gravity mechanics with premium visual aesthetics, allowing you to build everything from binary star systems to complex planetary arrangements around supermassive black holes.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌌 Advanced Physics Engine
- **N-Body Simulation:** Real-time gravitational interactions between dozens of celestial bodies simultaneously.
- **Spacetime Curvature:** Dynamic "Gravity Grid" visualization that warps based on the mass and position of objects.
- **Stability Metrics:** Real-time calculation of **Hill Spheres** and **Roche Limits** to help you design stable orbital systems.
- **GPGPU Particles:** GPU-accelerated dust and cosmic systems that react to the gravity of nearby planets and stars.

### 🪐 Stunning Visuals
- **Realistic Black Holes:** Kerr-type event horizons with relativistic Doppler shifting, gravitational lensing, and dynamic accretion disks.
- **Detailed Planets:** Procedural "rocky" and "gas" textures with volumetric atmospheres, cloud layers, and axial tilt.
- **Celestial Variety:** Simulate Stars, Red Giants, Neutron Stars (with pulsar jets), and Dwarf Planets.
- **Habitable Zones:** Visual indicators for the Circumstellar Habitable Zone (Goldilocks zone) around stars.
- **Supernova Events:** Dynamic explosion effects and shockwaves when stars reach the end of their lifecycle.

### 🛠️ Strategic Tools & UI
- **Catapult Launch:** Precision-based object placement with velocity và direction control using a "drag-to-launch" mechanic.
- **Time Manipulation:** Control the pace of the universe—pause, slow down, or accelerate time to watch eons pass in seconds.
- **Glassmorphism Interface:** A modern, sleek UI for managing your "Universe Collection," featuring folder organization and world metadata.
- **Portfolio & Credits:** Dedicated panel showcasing project contributors and development highlights.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 & TypeScript
- **Graphics:** Three.js with React Three Fiber (R3F)
- **Shaders:** Custom GLSL for planetary surfaces, relativistic effects, and GPGPU physics.
- **State Management:** Zustand for lightweight, performant global state.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a premium, responsive UI.
